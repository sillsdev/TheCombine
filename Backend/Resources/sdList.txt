1`63403699-07c1-43f3-a47c-069d6e4316e5`Universe, creation`Use this domain for general words referring to the physical universe. Some languages may not have a single word for the universe and may have to use a phrase such as 'rain, soil, and things of the sky' or 'sky, land, and water' or a descriptive phrase such as 'everything you can see' or 'everything that exists'.
1.1`999581c4-1611-4acb-ae1b-5e6c1dfe6f0c`Sky`Use this domain for words related to the sky.
1.1.1`dc1a2c6f-1b32-4631-8823-36dacc8cb7bb`Sun`Use this domain for words related to the sun. The sun does three basic things. It moves, it gives light, and it gives heat. These three actions are involved in the meanings of most of the words in this domain. Since the sun moves below the horizon, many words refer to it setting or rising. Since the sun is above the clouds, many words refer to it moving behind the clouds and the clouds blocking its light. The sun's light and heat also produce secondary effects. The sun causes plants to grow, and it causes damage to things.
1.1.1.1`1bd42665-0610-4442-8d8d-7c666fee3a6d`Moon`Use this domain for words related to the moon. In your culture people may believe things about the moon. For instance in European culture people used to believe that the moon caused people to become crazy. So in English we have words like "moon-struck" and "lunatic." You should include such words in this domain.
1.1.1.2`b044e890-ce30-455c-aede-7e9d5569396e`Star`Use this domain for words related to the stars and other heavenly bodies.

Some cultures do not study the stars and will have few or no words in this domain. Others cultures that study the stars will have many words. There are only five planets that people can see in the sky--Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The others are only known from the scientific study of astronomy.

1.1.3.1`93b8bd61-137a-4ebc-b12f-52fa5d2b3ea4`Wind`Use this domain for words related to the wind. Some words refer to when the wind begins and ends. The wind changes in speed, so some words refer to how fast the wind is moving. Try to rank these on a scale from very slow to very fast. These words may also be distinguished by what the wind does, since a fast wind does more things. These words may also be distinguished by how long the wind blows. Some words refer to the speed of the wind becoming faster or slower. Some words distinguish a steady wind from a wind in which the speed keeps changing. Some words refer to when the speed of the wind becomes faster for a short time. A steady wind moves in a particular direction, so there are words that include the direction of the wind. The direction of the wind may refer to the points of the compass, a neighboring geographical feature or area, or the direction in which the speaker is moving. Some words refer to a wind that moves in a small circle, making a pillar of dust or a funnel-shaped cloud. Some words refer to what the wind does, such as when it moves or damages something. People can feel the wind, so some words refer to how it feels. The wind makes noise, so there are words that refer to the sound of the wind. In some cultures there is a relation between the wind and spirits, so some words may refer to the activity of the spirits in the wind, or that the wind brings disease.

1.5`025da6f4-b1b6-423a-8c0f-b324f531a6f1`Plant`Use this domain for general words for all plants. Use a book of pictures to identify plant names and the scientific name. Languages divide plants into various domains that are not always comparable from language to language. Criterial features may be characteristics (trees and bushes are distinguished by size and number of trunks) and use (grass and weeds are distinguished by their desirability). A common distinction is between trees and non-trees, with trees described as being big, woody, and having a life expectancy of several years, while non-trees are small, non-woody, and have a life expectancy of typically not more than one year (Heine, Bernd and Karsten Legere. 1995. Swahili plants. Rudiger Koppe Verlag: Koln.). Agricultural societies will divide plants into wild and cultivated. However most plants for which there are names have some use. Therefore it does not seem helpful to divide plant names into domains for useful and non-useful plants. Since only parts of plants are eaten, edible parts of plants are listed under the domain 'Food'. Some languages may have more domains than are used in this list, others may have fewer. The classification system used here does not agree entirely with the system used by botanists. For instance botanists do not classify all the tree species together. The palm trees belong to the class Monocotyledoneae and are classified with lilies, bananas, and orchids. Apple and cherry trees belong to the class Dicotyledoneae and are classified in the rose family along with roses and blackberries. The acacia tree also belongs to the class Dicotyledoneae and is classified in the pulse family along with lupines and beans. However most folk taxonomies bring all the trees together. The scientific classification system for plants and animals is taken from: Carruth, Gorton, ed. 1989. The Volume Library, Vols. 1 and 2. The Southwestern Company: Nashville.
1.5.1`0ee5b933-f1ab-485f-894a-51fe239cb726`Tree`Use this domain for trees--flowering plants with roots, stems, and leaves, which are large and have a wooden trunk (Phylum Spermatophyta, Subdivision Angiospermae). Also include the evergreen trees (Phylum Spermatophyta, Subdivision Gymnospermae). Evergreen trees do not have flowers, but have cone like fruits (pinecones) that contain seeds. Their leaves are shaped like needles and are retained for over a year.
1.5.2`531af868-b5fb-41c2-ba50-764458f9102f`Bush, shrub`Use this domain for bushes and shrubs--plants that are smaller than trees and have several wooden trunks (Phylum Spermatophyta, Subdivision Angiospermae).
1.5.3`c345f278-91ff-463d-b9a6-8abac8a267eb`Grass, herb, vine`Use this domain for small plants that have roots, stems, flowers, and seeds, but do not have a wooden trunk (Phylum Spermatophyta, Subdivision Angiospermae). Also include the seedless plants, such as ferns (phylum Pteridophyta, class Felicineae), horsetails (phylum Pteridophyta, class Equisetineae), and club mosses (phylum Pteridophyta, class Lycopodineae). Plants of the Pteridophyta phylum have no flowers or seeds. Ferns have large, divided, feather-like leaves, or fronds. Club mosses are small (rarely over one meter) evergreen plants with simple leaves resembling pine or hemlock needles. Sometimes they grow upright, but often trail on the ground, where they propagate by means of runners. Horsetails send up tall, vertical, jointed stalks with branches covered with scale like leaves.
1.5.4`d06dae77-134a-403f-ba88-52ecd66c0522`Moss, fungus, algae`Use this domain for mosses (phylum Bryophyta, class Musci), liverworts (phylum Bryophyta, class Hepaticae), fungi (phylum Thallophyta, subdivision Fungi), algae (phylum Thallophyta, subdivision Algae), and lichens. These plants do not have true roots, stems, or leaves. The mosses are small, green, flowerless plants that grow in moist environments and look like velvety or feathery growths carpeting the ground, tree trunks, and rocks. The liverworts are similar to the mosses with a flat and branching growth pattern. The algae possess green chlorophyll. They vary from one-celled organisms, which sometimes live in colonies such as pond scum, to complex organisms such as seaweed. The fungi do not possess chlorophyll and feed off of other organic material. Lichens consist of a fungus and an algae growing together. They commonly grow on trunks of trees and rocks. Some are flat and leafy, and some are moss like.
1.5.5`d117aa22-3f18-47c4-9683-51ecf1dc7134`Parts of a plant`Use this domain for words that refer to parts of a plant. Start with general words that all plants have. Then think through each major type of plant. Finish by thinking of specific plants that are well known (usually cultivated crops) and that have words for specific parts (e.g. tassel on a corn/maize cob).

This section is organized according to the scientific, biological classification of animals. It may not correspond to the local classification of animals (folk taxonomy), which are often based on how people relate to animals (tame/wild, edible/work). Use this domain for words referring to large classes of animals that do not correspond to the scientific classification. For instance this would be the place for a word like 'flying animal', which includes birds, bats, and flying insects.

9`349f0278-7998-422a-9c3b-6053989cbb20`Grammar`Use this domain for technical linguistic terms that refer to grammatical words and constructions. Most languages have few if any words in this domain.
9.1`3a2c0773-6b3e-4f8b-909d-c8f84d66d4f4`General words`Use the following section for words that don't belong in any other domain because they are so general in meaning that you can use them to talk about any topic. Use this domain for general and indefinite words that can be used in the place of any word. Some languages have a general word that can replace a noun or a verb. For instance some Philippine languages use the word 'kwan' in this way. Colloquial German can use the word 'dings' as a noun or verb. Often these words are used when you can't remember the particular word you are trying to think of. In English we use the word 'blank' when we don't want to say a word, for instance when we are testing someone and want them to say the word.
9.1.1`a72ca6f7-e389-408a-8276-fec4d60a3a56`Be`Many languages have general words that indicate some kind of state. These general words may be used with a wide variety of specific meanings.

9.1.1.2`093eeea2-4ff6-4ee8-ad05-8af1702b7246`Become, change state`Many languages have general words that indicate some kind of change of state. These general words may be used with a wide variety of specific meanings. For instance in English the word 'become' may be used to a change in identity, a change in characteristic, a change in nature, and many other ideas.
9.1.1.3`da988f73-fc9d-4a23-b70d-22299a7c6097`Have, of`Many languages have several general words that are used to indicate a variety of relationships between two things. There are three such words in English: "have," "of," and the possessive suffix "-'s." The basic meaning of these words in English is 'to own', but they can mean many other things too. For instance they can mean that I am related to someone (I have a brother), something has a part (birds have wings), and many other ideas. There is also a set of pronouns in English that are like nouns ending in -'s (my/mine, your/yours, his, her/hers, its, our/ours, their/theirs, whose). Use this domain for these general words.
9.1.1.4`94cad4ca-c2ec-4ff3-b9b1-11107549941d`Attribution`Attributes often belong to a class of attributes (shape = straight, curved) or to a scale (length = long, short). The class or scale can sometimes be included in the expression, but does not mark the proposition itself. (The towel <feels> damp. The box <weighs> five kilos.)
9.1.2`e28f3f79-d4a5-402c-8a70-196856791078`Do`Use this domain for general verbs with a volitional subject (agent).
9.1.2.1`b158fe11-5af2-4467-bbc0-cc1aee766592`Happen`Use this domain for non-volitional pro-verbs.
9.1.2.2`12a028d1-d910-4011-ab9d-59be69daaf65`React, respond`Use this domain for words referring to reacting or responding to something.

9.1.2.7`754ac437-2841-48c3-bbb0-7d6dff52605e`Event propositions`Use this domain for words that indicate event propositions. Event propositions are similar in that they are normally expressed by a subject and a verb, possibly including an object, indirect object, or complement clause. However there are multiple ways in which a language can express an event, such as a passive construction, noun phrase, or subordinate clause. In addition each event type is different in its primary cases, and in the ways those cases are marked. Each event type has subtypes, such as intransitive, transitive, and bitransitive verbs. A great deal of research is needed in order to identify all the variations. Ultimately every verb must be investigated to determine how it behaves in each syntactic construction and how its case relations are marked. No two verbs are entirely alike.
9.1.3`0037693a-ae42-4e5c-85f5-10a05482d4ee`Thing`Use this domain for general words referring to things.

9.1.4`316f27aa-ed6d-4bc3-9d14-840946a6f4e9`General adjectives`Use this domain for general adjectives that can replace or stand for a specific adjective.
9.1.5`d9b9db39-d87e-4d04-8298-1f1b969dbda1`General adverbs`Use this domain for general adverbs that can replace or stand for other adverbs.
9.2`af0909a5-928a-4421-baaa-f33b14302714`Part of speech`This domain is for organization purposes and should not be used for any words. Use the domains in this section for words that belong to a particular part of speech. It is best not to use these domains, since they are based on grammar and not meaning. But if you have a small group of words that belong to a part of speech and you want to list them all, you can use these domains. You can also classify words in this section if you don't know what they mean yet.
9.2.1`64f39297-426b-45a8-b5d2-097cf71d688c`Adjectives`Use this domain to list all adjectives. If there are many adjectives in your language, you should not try to list them all here. If you want to find all the adjectives, most dictionary programs can sort your dictionary by part of speech. However if your language only has a few adjectives, you can list them all in this domain. In the book, "Where Have All the Adjectives Gone?" R. M. W. Dixon [Dixon, R. M. W. 1982. Where have all the adjectives gone? Berlin: Mouton.] identifies seven universal semantic types that are often expressed by adjectives. They are: Age (new, young, old), Dimension (big, little, long, short, wide, narrow, thick, fat, thin), Value (good, bad, proper, perfect, excellent, fine, delicious, atrocious, poor), Color (black, white, red), Human propensity (jealous, happy, kind, clever, generous, cruel, rude, proud, wicked), Physical property (hard, soft, heavy, light, rough, smooth, hot, cold, sweet, sour), Speed (fast, slow). Words in the Human propensity class may be nouns. Words in the Physical property and Speed classes may be verbs.
9.2.2`24d3d7f9-0fda-4759-930b-6b721d3e9115`Adverbs`Use this domain to list all adverbs. If there are many adverbs in your language, it is probably not worth the trouble to list them here. The Shoebox program (and other dictionary programs) can sort your dictionary by part of speech.
9.2.3`0296465a-25de-4af6-a122-376956b4b452`Pronouns`Use this domain for the personal pronouns, including independent, subject, object, and possessive pronouns. It is best to collect all the pronouns in a chart. This way you are more certain of collecting them all and seeing how they are related to each other. A language may have more sets and more distinctions than English does, or it may have less. For instance some languages have a pronoun 'we' which includes the hearer, and another pronoun 'we' which excludes the hearer. Other languages have an indefinite pronoun that means something like the English word 'someone'. Many languages do not have the masculine (he), feminine (she), and neuter (it) distinctions that English has. It is necessary to determine the sets and functions of the pronouns for each language.
9.2.3.1`13df6ee2-4189-4faa-b54d-768588d03978`Reflexive pronouns`Use this domain for pronouns that refer back to the subject of the sentence. These pronouns should be added to the chart of personal pronouns.
9.2.3.2`d4521b0f-0703-48cc-94a0-f42ccc09959c`Indefinite pronouns`Use this domain for pronouns that do not refer to a definite person or thing, but can refer to anyone or anything. Some languages will not have all the sets of pronouns described below. Add each set you find in your language to the pronoun chart.
9.2.3.3`8db17eef-6c42-4ba0-9f07-a3b0e7c8f1e1`Relative pronouns`Use this domain for pronouns used in relative clauses.
9.2.3.4`76795fdd-55dc-4fb7-a9ad-d1423c31df50`Question words`Use this domain for pronouns used in questions.

9.5`aab82dc7-de9f-44b3-845e-0c926f47cfb6`Case`Each verb has a set of semantic case relations. For instance in the sentence 'I gave flowers to my wife' the verb give has three case relations. 'I' is the Agent, 'flowers' is the Patient, and 'my wife is the 'Recipient'. In this sentence the only word that marks a case relation is 'to'. English often marks case relations by their position in the sentence. Some languages mark case relations by affixes, prepositions, postpositions, and sometimes special verbs. To completely describe a language, each verb must be investigated, all its case relations must be identified, and all the ways in which these relations are marked must be described. Since verbs are often unique and unpredictable in their case relations, this information should go into the dictionary. This section should be used to classify the words and affixes that are used to mark case relations. This domain should be used for technical terms that refer to case.

If the house was for his father to live in, then "for" would mark the 'Beneficiary of a patient', meaning that the house was for the father. If, on the other hand, the father was intending to build the house to sell, but couldn't due to an injury, then "for" would mark the 'Beneficiary of an event', meaning the father benefited from the building of the house.

These may use a verb meaning 'look' or 'listen'. Some may be a word specifically referring to attention. Others may be a greeting. Others may be words that refer to non-verbal communication such as clearing your throat.
9.6.3.4`577a9f51-263a-4c80-a439-84ce45b9c7cc`Markers of direct address`Use this domain for words that the speaker uses to refer to the person he is addressing.

9.6.3.8`2e5a80f9-35ae-4850-9627-be530832a781`Honorifics`Use this domain for words that the speaker uses to show respect or a lack of respect to the person he is addressing. Some languages have elaborate systems of honorifics. Other languages have none. Languages with a stratified social structure often use honorifics. Egalitarian societies generally lack them, but some egalitarian societies may use them. For instance in Nahuatl there are four levels of honorifics. Level 1 is how one addresses intimates, small children, and pets. Level 2 is for strangers and persons treated formally. Level 3 is for respected persons, the dead, and God. Level 4 is for obsequious respect, as for the archbishop in an interview with a priest, and for ritual kin. (Jane H. Hill and Kenneth C. Hill. 1978. Honorific usage in modern Nahuatl: the expression of social distance and respect in the Nahuatl of the Malinche Volcano area, Language 54:123-155.) In Japanese, which has a stratified social structure, a person uses one set of words and affixes when speaking to someone below you in the social hierarchy, such as your wife, children, and pets. A different set of words is used when speaking to peers. Another set is used when speaking to a superior. A fourth set is used when speaking to the emperor. English used to have two pronouns for second person singular. 'Thou' was used for equals and inferiors, and 'you' was used for superiors. Your language may have special honorific words used as (1) pronouns, (2) affixes, (3) particles, (4) terms of direct address, (5) greetings (6) requests, (7) apologies.
9.7`5b7666bd-c6c1-45e7-aa2e-1799fcb16d97`Name`Use this domain for general words referring to proper nouns--the name given to a particular person or thing to distinguish it from other things like it. Proper nouns are often not included in a dictionary, or are included in an appendix at the front or back of a dictionary. This is because there are so many of them, they are sometimes difficult to define, and it saves space in the dictionary. For instance place names can be included in a map. So it might be good to type the proper nouns into a special file.
9.7.1`7b513a02-c3ae-4243-9410-16854d911258`Name of a person`Use this domain for words related to the name of a person. Each culture has a system of personal names to identify individuals and kin groups. The subcategories under this heading should reflect the cultural system. If your language has a special set of names that do not fit any of they domains given here, then set up a special domain.
9.7.1.1`6b921117-47e9-4717-b3b3-4e170d26b6d9`Personal names`Use this domain for those names that are given to people, that people use to call to each other and to talk about each other.

9.7.1.3`774cdff1-8cba-4f94-a519-c66abd3b5f49`Clan names`Use this domain for the proper names of the clans that exist within the language community. The distinction between family, clan, tribe, and nation is based on politics and emotion. Our purpose here is not to make political statements, but merely to list the names. There may be no distinction between family and clan, in which case ignore this domain and use the domain 'Family names'.
9.7.1.4`5771f3a1-fda3-4111-9abc-7a0d76c60a79`Tribal names`Use this domain for the proper names of the tribes that exist around the language community, including the name of your own tribe. These tribal names may or may not correspond with the names of countries.

These language names may or may not correspond with the names of countries. Do not try to include every language name in the world, only the neighboring and important ones. For instance you might want to include the languages that border your own and the national language. Give the form that you use. For instance the German people call their language 'Deutsch', but in English we call it 'German'.
9.7.1.6`94f573ff-29f0-42ae-b1d9-f882823b2935`Nickname`Use this domain for common nicknames--an additional name given to a person later in life, often descriptive. Also include general names used to call or refer to someone when you don't know their name

9.7.2.1`ee0585b1-627a-4a71-888d-b5d82619431e`Names of countries`Use this domain for the proper names of the countries that exist around the language community, especially those countries where your language is spoken. Include the name of your own country. Do not list every country in the world, unless your language has developed special names or pronunciations for those countries. Include any country that you refer to in your language, especially those names whose pronunciation you have adapted to fit your language. Give the form of the name that you use, rather than the official spelling. For instance the Japanese refer to their country as 'Nihon', but in English will call it 'Japan'. So 'Japan' is an English word and should go into an English dictionary. But 'Nihon' is not an English word and should not go in the dictionary.
9.7.2.2`85cb1e3c-62ba-4a77-a838-0237707fb0cb`Names of regions`Use this domain for the proper names of the regions within your country or language area. Some of these may be political regions. Others may be informal terms. Give the local pronunciation, rather than some foreign spelling. You may want to limit this domain to just those areas within your language area. However if you have special names for areas outside of your language area, for example 'the Mideast', you should include them.
9.7.2.3`b8e66bb4-140c-45b4-89ce-d9a77b9e5d21`Names of cities`Use this domain for the proper names of cities, towns, and villages in the language area. Include the names of important cities outside of the language area if your language has a special name for the city or a different pronunciation for it. It might be good to use a map for this. In fact it is good to include a map of the language area in a published dictionary. If your language area is very large, there may be hundreds or thousands of cities, towns, and villages. In this case you will have to decide which should be included in the dictionary. Or you could decided to list them in a special section.
9.7.2.4`35a9da32-53ee-44fa-9c65-5a15f88ad283`Names of streets`Use this domain for the proper names of highways, roads, streets, and trails in the language area. If there are many such names, only include the important names (e.g. King's Highway) or commonly used names (e.g. Main Street).

9.7.3`7d111356-e04e-4891-960c-2f35147eba82`Name of a thing`Use this domain for words related to the name of a thing. Many cultures give names to particular buildings, ships, airplanes, organizations, companies, schools, and other things. If your language has hundreds of names for some kind of thing, it is best to not try to list them all. But if there are a few important names for one kind of thing, set up a domain for them.
