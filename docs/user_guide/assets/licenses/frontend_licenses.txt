[API Reference Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/%40aspnet/signalr/?view=signalr-js-latest) is also available on learn.microsoft.com.

For documentation on using this client with Azure SignalR Service and Azure Functions, see the [SignalR Service serverless developer guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-concept-serverless-development-config).

### Browser

To use the client in a browser, copy `*.js` files from the `dist/browser` folder to your script folder include on your page using the `<script>` tag.

### WebWorker

To use the client in a webworker, copy `*.js` files from the `dist/webworker` folder to your script folder include on your webworker using the `importScripts` function. Note that webworker SignalR hub connection supports only absolute path to a SignalR hub.

### Node.js

To use the client in a NodeJS application, install the package to your `node_modules` folder and use `require('@microsoft/signalr')` to load the module. The object returned by `require('@microsoft/signalr')` has the same members as the global `signalR` object (when used in a browser).

### Example (Browser)

```javascript
let connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chat")
    .build();

connection.on("send", data => {
    console.log(data);
});

connection.start()
    .then(() => connection.invoke("send", "Hello"));
```

### Example (WebWorker)

```javascript
importScripts('signalr.js');

let connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("https://example.com/signalr/chat")
    .build();

connection.on("send", data => {
    console.log(data);
});

connection.start()
    .then(() => connection.invoke("send", "Hello"));

```

### Example (NodeJS)

```javascript
const signalR = require("@microsoft/signalr");

let connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chat")
    .build();

connection.on("send", data => {
    console.log(data);
});

connection.start()
    .then(() => connection.invoke("send", "Hello"));
```

fetch-cookie 2.2.0
Unlicense
# 🍪 fetch-cookie [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/fetch-cookie?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/fetch-cookie) [![Build status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/valeriangalliat/fetch-cookie/test.yml?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/valeriangalliat/fetch-cookie/actions/workflows/test.yml)

> Decorator for a `fetch` function to support automatic cookie storage
> and population.

[Migrating from v1](#migrating-from-v1)

## Description

fetch-cookie wraps around a `fetch` function and **intercepts request
options and response objects to store received cookies and populate
request with the appropriate cookies**.

This library is developed with Node.js and `fetch` polyfill libraries such
as [node-fetch] in mind, since the browser version is supposed to let a
way [to include cookies in requests][include]. Compatibility may not be
guaranteed but as long as your library implements the [Fetch standard]
you should be fine. In case of incompatibilities, please create a new
issue.

[Fetch standard]: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/
[node-fetch]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch
[include]: http://updates.html5rocks.com/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch#sending-credentials-with-a-fetch-request

Internally the plugin uses a cookie jar. You can insert your own
(details below) but [tough-cookie] is preferred.

[tough-cookie]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie

## Usage

With Node.js 18.3.0 and greater, using the native global `fetch`
function:

```js
import makeFetchCookie from 'fetch-cookie'

const fetchCookie = makeFetchCookie(fetch)
```

Or with node-fetch:

```js
import nodeFetch from 'node-fetch'
import fetchCookie from 'fetch-cookie'

const fetch = fetchCookie(nodeFetch)
```

### Custom cookie jar

If you want to customize the internal cookie jar instance (for example,
with a custom store), you can inject it as a second argument:

```js
import makeFetchCookie from 'fetch-cookie'

const fetchCookie = makeFetchCookie(fetch, new makeFetchCookie.toughCookie.CookieJar())
```

Here, we expose the tough-cookie version that we depend on internally so
you can just reuse it and don't end up accidentally bundling two
different versions. That being said you can use any version of
tough-cookie here, or even any compatible cookie jar.

This enables you to create multiple fetch-cookie instances that use
different cookie jars, essentially two different HTTP clients with
different login sessions on you backend (for example).

All calls to `fetch` will store and send back cookies according to the
URL.

If you use a cookie jar that is not tough-cookie, keep in mind that it
must implement this interface to be compatible:

```ts
interface CookieJar {
  getCookieString(currentUrl: string): Promise<string>
  setCookie(cookieString: string, currentUrl: string, opts: { ignoreError: boolean }): Promise
}
```

### Custom cookie jar with options

If you don't want a custom store and just want to pass [tough-cookie
options](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie#cookiejarstore-options),
e.g. to allow cookies on `localhost`:

```js
import makeFetchCookie from 'fetch-cookie'

const fetchCookie = makeFetchCookie(fetch, new makeFetchCookie.toughCookie.CookieJar(undefined, {
  allowSpecialUseDomain: true
}))
```

Or with a custom store as well:

```js
import makeFetchCookie from 'fetch-cookie'
import FileCookieStore from 'file-cookie-store'

const store = new FileCookieStore('cookies.txt')

const fetchCookie = makeFetchCookie(fetch, new makeFetchCookie.toughCookie.CookieJar(store, {
  allowSpecialUseDomain: true
}))
```

### Ignoring errors

All errors when setting cookies are ignored by default. You can make it
throw errors in cookies by passing a third argument `ignoreError` (defaulting to `true`).

```js
import makeFetchCookie from 'fetch-cookie'

const fetchCookie = makeFetchCookie(fetch, new makeFetchCookie.toughCookie.CookieJar(), false)
```

When set to `false`, fetch-cookie will throw when an error occurs in
setting cookies and breaks the request and execution.

Otherwise, it silently ignores errors and continues to make
requests/redirections.

### Max redirects

Because we need to do our own [redirect implementation](#cookies-on-redirects),
the way to configure the max redirects is not going to be that of your
chosen `fetch` implementation, but custom to fetch-cookie.

We read a `maxRedirect` parameter for that. The default is 20.

```js
import makeFetchCookie from 'fetch-cookie'

const fetchCookie = makeFetchCookie(fetch)

await fetchCookie(url, { maxRedirect: 10 })
```

## Cookies on redirects

In order to handle cookies on redirects, we force the `redirect`
parameter to `manual`, and handle the redirections internally (according
to the original `redirect` value) instead of leaving it to the upstream
`fetch` implementation.

This allows us to hook into the redirect logic in order to store and
forward cookies accordingly.

This is useful for example when a login page sets a session cookie and
redirects to another page.

## Migrating from v1

The only breaking change with v2 is that the node-fetch wrapper (that
was handling redirects only with node-fetch nonstandard APIs) was
dropped and the redirects are now always handled by the main export.

```js
// If you were doing
const fetchCookie = require('fetch-cookie/node-fetch')

// Change it to
const fetchCookie = require('fetch-cookie')

// Or
import fetchCookie from 'fetch-cookie'
```

This also means that if you were *not* using the node-fetch wrapper and
were happy about cookies *not* being included in redirects, cookies are
now going to be stored and sent in redirects as well like they would in
the browser.

## Development

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Allows to test node-fetch v2 as well as node-fetch v3
npm --prefix test/node_modules/node-fetch-2 ci

# Allows to test against Undici by removing the blacklisting of `Set-Cookie` headers
npm run patch-undici

npm run lint
npm run type-check

# Generates code in `esm` and `cjs` directories
npm run build

# Run tests (depends on the built code)
npm test

# Generate type declarations in the `types` directory
npm run type-declarations
```

## Credits

* 🥰 All the [contributors](https://github.com/valeriangalliat/fetch-cookie/graphs/contributors)
  to fetch-cookie!
* 😍 [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch) for the
  redirect logic that we carefully mimic (sadly reimplementing this code
  was the only way to support cookies in redirects).

html-parse-stringify 3.0.1
MIT
# html-parse-stringify

This is an _experimental lightweight approach_ to enable quickly parsing HTML into an AST and stringify'ing it back to the original string.

As it turns out, if you can make a the simplifying assumptions about HTML that all tags must be closed or self-closing. Which is OK for _this_ particular application. You can write a super light/fast parser in JS with regex.

"Why on earth would you do this?! Haven't you read: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags ?!?!"

Why yes, yes I have :)

But the truth is. If you _could_ do this in a whopping grand total of ~600 bytes (min+gzip) as this repo shows. It potentially enables DOM diffing based on a HTML strings to be super light and fast in a browser. What is that you say? DOM-diffing?

Yes.

React.js essentially pioneered the approach. With React you render to a "virtual DOM" whenever you want to, and the virtual DOM can then diff against the real DOM (or the last virtual DOM) and then turn that diff into whatever transformations are necessary to get the _real_ DOM to match what you rendered as efficiently as possible.

As a result, when you're building a single page app, you don't have to worry so much about bindings. Instead, you simple re-render to the virtual DOM whenever you know something's changed. All of a sudden being able to have `change` events for individual properties becomes less important, instead you can just reference those values in your template whenever you think something changed.

Cool idea, right?!

## So why this?

Well, there are other things React expects me to do if I use it that I don't like. Such as the custom templating and syntax you have to use.

If, hypothetically, you could instead diff an HTML string (generated by _whatever_ templating language of your choice) against the DOM, then you'd get the same benefit, sans React's impositions.

This may all turn out to be a bad idea altogether, but initial results seem promising when paired with [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom).

But you can't just diff HTML strings, as simple strings, very easily, in order to diff two HTML node trees you have to first turn that string into a tree structure of some sort. Typically, the thing you generate from parsing something like this is called an AST (abstract syntax tree).

This lib does exactly that.

It has two methods:

1. parse
2. stringify

## `.parse(htmlString, options)`

Takes a string of HTML and turns it into an AST, the only option you can currently pass is an object of registered `components` whose children will be ignored when generating the AST.

## `.stringify(AST)`

Takes an AST and turns it back into a string of HTML.

## What does the AST look like?

See comments in the following example:

```js
var HTML = require('html-parse-stringify')

// this html:
var html = '<div class="oh"><p>hi</p></div>'

// becomes this AST:
var ast = HTML.parse(html)

console.log(ast)
/*
{
    // can be `tag`, `text` or `component`
    type: 'tag',

    // name of tag if relevant
    name: 'div',
    
    // parsed attribute object
    attrs: {
        class: 'oh'
    },

    // whether this is a self-closing tag
    // such as <img/>
    voidElement: false,

    // an array of child nodes
    // we see the same structure
    // repeated in each of these
    children: [
        {
            type: 'tag',
            name: 'p',
            attrs: {},
            voidElement: false,
            children: [
                // this is a text node
                // it also has a `type`
                // but nothing other than
                // a `content` containing
                // its text.
                {
                    type: 'text',
                    content: 'hi'
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
*/
```

## the AST node types

### 1. tag

properties:

- `type` - will always be `tag` for this type of node
- `name` - tag name, such as 'div'
- `attrs` - an object of key/value pairs. If an attribute has multiple space-separated items such as classes, they'll still be in a single string, for example: `class: "class1 class2"`
- `voidElement` - `true` or `false`. Whether this tag is a known void element as defined by [spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#void-elements).
- `children` - array of child nodes. Note that any continuous string of text is a text node child, see below.

### 2. text

properties:

- `type` - will always be `text` for this type of node
- `content` - text content of the node

### 3. component

If you pass an object of `components` as part of the `options` object passed as the second argument to `.parse()` then the AST won't keep parsing that branch of the DOM tree when it one of those registered components.

This is so that it's possible to ignore sections of the tree that you may want to handle by another "subview" in your application that handles it's own DOM diffing.

properties:

- `type` - will always be `component` for this type of node
- `name` - tag name, such as 'div'
- `attrs` - an object of key/value pairs. If an attribute has multiple space-separated items such as classes, they'll still be in a single string, for example: `class: "class1 class2"`
- `voidElement` - `true` or `false`. Whether this tag is a known void element as defined by [spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#void-elements).
- `children` - it will still have a `children` array, but it will always be empty.

## changelog

- `3.0.1` Merged #47 which makes void elements check case insensitive. Thanks again, [@adrai](https://github.com/adrai) for this contribution!
- `3.0.0` Merged #46 which fixed an issue with handling of whitespace. Doing major version bump since this changes behavior if you have whitespace only nodes (see merged PR and #45 for more details). Thanks [@adrai](https://github.com/adrai) for this contribution!
- `2.1.1` Merged #41 which fixed an issue with tag nesting. Thanks [@ericponto](https://github.com/ericponto).
- `2.1.0` Merged support for numeric tags. This allows a use case described in [this PR](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/html-parse-stringify/pull/43). Thanks [@kachkaev](https://github.com/kachkaev).
- `2.0.3` Fixed failed publish. Accidentally published an empty package :sweat_smile:
- `2.0.2` Fixed incorrect attribution for vulnerability disclosure. The vulnerability was discovered by Yeting Li. Sam Sanoop was the one who reached out to me about it.
- `2.0.1` Addressing a reported regular expression denial of service issue found by [Yeting Li](https://github.com/yetingli) and reported to me by [Sam Sanoop](https://twitter.com/snoopysecurity) of [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) THANK YOU!. The issue was that sending certain input would cause one of the regular expressions we used to lock up and not finish, freezing the process. See the test that was added for details. To be clear, this lib wasn't meant for parsing non-well formed HTML. But, better safe than sorry! So we're fixing it.
- `2.0.0` updated to more modern dependencies/build system. Switched to prettier, etc. No big feature differences, just new build system/project structure. Added support for top level text nodes thanks to @jperl. Added support for comments thanks to @pconerly.
- `1.0.0 - 1.0.3` no big changes, bug fixes and speed improvements.
