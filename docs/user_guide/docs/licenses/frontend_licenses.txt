### Installation

Note that this package requires `@material-ui/core` **v4**. It will not work with the old v3. Please read the [migration guide](https://material-ui-pickers.dev/guides/upgrading-to-v3) if you are updating from v2

```sh
// via npm
npm i @material-ui/pickers

// via yarn
yarn add @material-ui/pickers
```

Now choose the library that pickers will use to work with date. We are providing interfaces for [moment](https://momentjs.com/), [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/), [dayjs](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs) and [date-fns v2](https://date-fns.org/). If you are not using moment in the project (or don’t have it in the bundle already) we suggest using date-fns or luxon, because they are much lighter and will be correctly tree-shaked from the bundle. Note, that we are fully relying on [date-io](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/date-io) for supporting different libraries.

```sh
npm i date-fns@next @date-io/date-fns
// or
npm i moment @date-io/moment
// or
npm i luxon @date-io/luxon
// or
npm i dayjs @date-io/dayjs
```

Then teach pickers which library to use with `MuiPickerUtilsProvider`. This component takes a utils property, and makes it available down the React tree thanks to React context. It should preferably be used at the root of your component tree.

```jsx
import MomentUtils from '@date-io/moment';
import DateFnsUtils from '@date-io/date-fns';
import LuxonUtils from '@date-io/luxon';
import { MuiPickersUtilsProvider } from '@material-ui/pickers';

function App() {
  return (
    <MuiPickersUtilsProvider utils={DateFnsUtils}>
      <Root />
    </MuiPickersUtilsProvider>
  );
}

render(<App />, document.querySelector('#app'));
```

@microsoft/signalr 5.0.16
Apache-2.0
JavaScript and TypeScript clients for SignalR for ASP.NET Core and Azure SignalR Service

## Installation

```bash
npm install @microsoft/signalr
# or
yarn add @microsoft/signalr
```

To try previews of the next version, use the `next` tag on NPM:

```bash
npm install @microsoft/signalr@next
# or
yarn add @microsoft/signalr@next
```

## Usage

See the [SignalR Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/signalr) at docs.microsoft.com for documentation on the latest release. [API Reference Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/%40aspnet/signalr/?view=signalr-js-latest) is also available on docs.microsoft.com.

For documentation on using this client with Azure SignalR Service and Azure Functions, see the [SignalR Service serverless developer guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-concept-serverless-development-config).

### Browser

To use the client in a browser, copy `*.js` files from the `dist/browser` folder to your script folder include on your page using the `<script>` tag.

### WebWorker

To use the client in a webworker, copy `*.js` files from the `dist/webworker` folder to your script folder include on your webworker using the `importScripts` function. Note that webworker SignalR hub connection supports only absolute path to a SignalR hub.

### Node.js

To use the client in a NodeJS application, install the package to your `node_modules` folder and use `require('@microsoft/signalr')` to load the module. The object returned by `require('@microsoft/signalr')` has the same members as the global `signalR` object (when used in a browser).

### Example (Browser)

```javascript
let connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chat")
    .build();

connection.on("send", data => {
    console.log(data);
});

connection.start()
    .then(() => connection.invoke("send", "Hello"));
```

### Example (WebWorker)

```javascript
importScripts('signalr.js');

let connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("https://example.com/signalr/chat")
    .build();

connection.on("send", data => {
    console.log(data);
});

connection.start()
    .then(() => connection.invoke("send", "Hello"));

```

### Example (NodeJS)

```javascript
const signalR = require("@microsoft/signalr");

let connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chat")
    .build();

connection.on("send", data => {
    console.log(data);
});

connection.start()
    .then(() => connection.invoke("send", "Hello"));
```

analytics.js 2.9.1

# Analytics.js [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci-link]

The hassle-free way to integrate analytics into any web application. 

Analytics.js is the open-source library that powers [Segment](https://segment.io). Segment is a hosted solution that gives you an interface by which to edit all of your settings, instead of having to write any code. It also extends the same functionality of Analytics.js to your [mobile apps](https://segment.io/libraries) and your [servers](https://segment.io/libraries).

## Documentation

First read the [Analytics.js QuickStart](https://segment.io/docs/tutorials/quickstart-analytics.js). For more detail check out the [Analytics.js Library Reference](https://segment.io/docs/libraries/analytics.js).

## Integrations

Looking to add support for a new integration, or modify an existing one? Take a look at the [segment-integrations](https://github.com/segment-integrations) organization, where all of the integration-specific code is stored. We love pull requests!

## Development

To get started with development, make sure you are running node `0.12`, clone the repository and then inside of it run:

```bash
$ make
```

That will build the `analytics.js` file, downloading all of the dependencies required to build it automatically. Then, edit as you please, and when you are ready to test run:

```bash
$ make test
```

That will build the latest version of `analytics.js`, lint all of the Javascript code, and run the specific tests automatically.

If you'd prefer to use the browser's developer tools, you can use:

```bash
$ make test-browser
```

Once your tests pass, you're ready to file a pull request!

fetch-cookie 0.7.3
Unlicense
# fetch-cookie [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/fetch-cookie.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/fetch-cookie) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/valeriangalliat/fetch-cookie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/valeriangalliat/fetch-cookie)

> Decorator for a `fetch` function to support automatic cookie storage and population.

## Description

`fetch-cookie` wraps arround a `fetch` function and **intercepts request options and response
objects to store received cookies and populate request with the appropriate cookies**.

This library is developed with Node.Js and fetch polyfill libraries such as [node-fetch] in mind, since
the browser version is supposed to let a way [to include cookies in requests][include].
Compatibility may not be guaranteed but as long as your library implements the [Fetch Standard] you should be fine.
In case of incompatibilities, please create a new issue.

[Fetch Standard]: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/
[node-fetch]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch
[include]: http://updates.html5rocks.com/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch#sending-credentials-with-a-fetch-request

Internally the plugin uses a cookie jar. You can insert your own (details below) but [tough-cookie] is preferred.

[tough-cookie]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie

## Usage

### Basic

```js
const nodeFetch = require('node-fetch')
const fetch = require('fetch-cookie')(nodeFetch)
```

### Custom cookie jar

If you want to customize the internal cookie jar instance (for example, with a custom store), you can inject it as a second argument:

```js
const nodeFetch = require('node-fetch')
const tough = require('tough-cookie')
const fetch = require('fetch-cookie')(nodeFetch, new tough.CookieJar())
```

This enables you to create multiple `fetch-cookie` instances that use different cookie jars,
esentially two different HTTP clients with different login sessions on you backend (for example).

All calls to `fetch` will store and send back cookies according to the URL.

### Cookies on redirects

**Details:** By default, cookies are not set correctly in the edge case where a response
sets cookies and redirects to another URL. A real-life example of this behaviour
is a login page setting a session cookie and redirecting.

The reason for this limitation is that the generic fetch API does not allow any way to
hook into redirects. However, the [node-fetch] library does expose its own API which
we can use.

**TLDR:** Ff cookies during indirection turns out to be a requirement for you,
and if you are using [node-fetch], then you can use the custom node-fetch decorator
provided with this library:

```js
const nodeFetch = require('node-fetch')
const fetch = require('fetch-cookie/node-fetch')(nodeFetch)
```

gud 1.0.0
MIT
# gud

> Create a 'gud nuff' (not cryptographically secure) globally unique id

## Install

```
yarn add gud
```

## Usage

```js
const gud = require('gud');

console.log(gud()); // 1
console.log(gud()); // 2
```

This is ever so slightly better than using something like `_.uniqueId` because
it will work across multiple copies of the same module.

Do not use this in place of actual UUIDs, security folks will hate me.

This will not be unique across processes/workers.

<!-- 🚨 HEY! HERE BEGINS THE INTERESTING STUFF 🚨 -->

## Wut? Poppers?

A popper is an element on the screen which "pops out" from the natural flow of your application.  
Common examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-downs.


## So, yet another tooltip library?

Well, basically, **no**.  
Popper.js is a **positioning engine**, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element
to make it possible to position it near a given reference element.  

The engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as **modifiers**
(similar to middlewares or plugins).  
The whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).

Popper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.  
It's used by big companies like [Twitter in Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Microsoft in WebClipper](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper) and [Atlassian in AtlasKit](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).

### Popper.js

This is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to
the poppers.

Some of the key points are:

- Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn't mess with your DOM!);
- Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries;
- Supports Shadow DOM elements;
- Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;

Visit our [project page](https://fezvrasta.github.io/popper.js) to see a lot of examples of what you can do with Popper.js!

Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md).


### Tooltip.js

Since lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects,
we created **Tooltip.js**.  
It's a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine Popper.js.  
Its API is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of Bootstrap, in this way it will be
easy to integrate it in your projects.  
The tooltips generated by Tooltip.js are accessible thanks to the `aria` tags.

Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/tooltip-documentation.md).


## Installation
Popper.js is available on the following package managers and CDNs:

| Source |                                                                                  |
|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| npm    | `npm install popper.js --save`                                                   |
| yarn   | `yarn add popper.js`                                                             |
| NuGet  | `PM> Install-Package popper.js`                                                  |
| Bower  | `bower install popper.js --save`                     |
| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/popper.js`](https://unpkg.com/popper.js)                     |
| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |

Tooltip.js as well:

| Source |                                                                                  |
|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| npm    | `npm install tooltip.js --save`                                                  |
| yarn   | `yarn add tooltip.js`                                                            |
| Bower* | `bower install tooltip.js=https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js --save`                   |
| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js`](https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js)                   |
| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |

\*: Bower isn't officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.js only trough the unpkg.com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects.  
For more info, [read the related issue](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/390).

### Dist targets

Popper.js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind: UMD, ESM and ESNext.

- UMD - Universal Module Definition: AMD, RequireJS and globals;
- ESM - ES Modules: For webpack/Rollup or browser supporting the spec;
- ESNext: Available in `dist/`, can be used with webpack and `babel-preset-env`;

Make sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a `<script>` tag, use UMD.

## Usage

Given an existing popper DOM node, ask Popper.js to position it near its button

```js
var reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');
var popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');
var anotherPopper = new Popper(
    reference,
    popper,
    {
        // popper options here
    }
);
```

### Callbacks

Popper.js supports two kinds of callbacks, the `onCreate` callback is called after
the popper has been initialized. The `onUpdate` one is called on any subsequent update.

```js
const reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');
const popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');
new Popper(reference, popper, {
    onCreate: (data) => {
        // data is an object containing all the informations computed
        // by Popper.js and used to style the popper and its arrow
        // The complete description is available in Popper.js documentation
    },
    onUpdate: (data) => {
        // same as `onCreate` but called on subsequent updates
    }
});
```

### Writing your own modifiers

Popper.js is based on a "plugin-like" architecture, most of its features are fully encapsulated "modifiers".  
A modifier is a function that is called each time Popper.js needs to compute the position of the popper. For this reason, modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks.  

To learn how to create a modifier, [read the modifiers documentation](docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#modifiers--object)


### React, Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Ember.js (etc...) integration

Integrating 3rd party libraries in React or other libraries can be a pain because
they usually alter the DOM and drive the libraries crazy.  
Popper.js limits all its DOM modifications inside the `applyStyle` modifier,
you can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using
your library of choice.  

For a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use Popper.js into existing
frameworks, visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page.

Alternatively, you may even override your own `applyStyles` with your custom one and
integrate Popper.js by yourself!

```js
function applyReactStyle(data) {
    // export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper
};

const reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');
const popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');
new Popper(reference, popper, {
    modifiers: {
        applyStyle: { enabled: false },
        applyReactStyle: {
            enabled: true,
            fn: applyReactStyle,
            order: 800,
        },
    },
});

```

### Migration from Popper.js v0

Since the API changed, we prepared some migration instructions to make it easy to upgrade to
Popper.js v1.  

https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/62

Feel free to comment inside the issue if you have any questions.

### Performances

Popper.js is very performant. It usually takes 0.5ms to compute a popper's position (on an iMac with 3.5G GHz Intel Core i5).  
This means that it will not cause any [jank](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/anatomy-of-jank), leading to a smooth user experience.

## Notes

### Libraries using Popper.js

The aim of Popper.js is to provide a stable and powerful positioning engine ready to
be used in 3rd party libraries.

# Redux DevTools Extension's helper

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension](https://badges.gitter.im/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension.svg)](https://gitter.im/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## Usage

Install:

```
npm install --save redux-devtools-extension
```

and use like that:

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';

const store = createStore(
  reducer,
  composeWithDevTools(
    applyMiddleware(...middleware)
    // other store enhancers if any
  )
);
```

or if needed to apply [extension’s options](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/blob/master/docs/API/Arguments.md#windowdevtoolsextensionconfig):

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';

const composeEnhancers = composeWithDevTools({
  // Specify here name, actionsBlacklist, actionsCreators and other options
});
const store = createStore(
  reducer,
  composeEnhancers(
    applyMiddleware(...middleware)
    // other store enhancers if any
  )
);
```

There’re just [few lines of code](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/blob/master/npm-package/index.js). If you don’t want to allow the extension in production, just use ‘redux-devtools-extension/developmentOnly’ instead of ‘redux-devtools-extension’.
