## Review Entries

The Review Entries table shows all entries in a project.

### Sorting and Filtering Columns

The columns are: Actions, Vernacular, Senses, Glosses, Domains, Pronunciations, Note, Flag, and Delete.

At the top of text-based columns (Vernacular, Glosses, Domains, Note, or Flag) you can sort alphabetically or filter
with a text search.

At the top of the Senses and Pronunciations columns you can sort or filter by the number of senses or recordings that
entries have.

There is also a Definitions column that can be turned on or off in [Project Settings](project.md#definitions).

### Editing Entry Rows

You can record, play, and delete an entry's audio recordings with the icons in the Pronunciations column. You can delete
an entry with the icon in the Delete column.

To edit an entry's vernacular, senses (including glosses and domains), note, or flag, click the icon in the Actions
column.
