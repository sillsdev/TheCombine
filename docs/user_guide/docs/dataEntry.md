# Data Entry

## Semantic Domain Tree

Browse or search for the domain of interest.

!!! tip

    To make searching for a domain quicker, The Combine will automatically insert `.` between consecutive digits as you
    type. For example, `1234` will automatically become `1.2.3.4`. This behavior does not happen if any non-numeric
    characters are entered.

## New Entry

### Vernacular

A word as found in the vernacular language, usually spelled either phonetically or with the local orthography.

### Gloss

An entry can have multiple senses/glosses, though only one can be added when the entry is first created.

### Note

There is only one note per entry, even if the entry has multiple senses, glosses, or semantic domains.

### Recording

You can add multiple recordings to an entry (e.g., a male voice and a female voice). As with the [Note](#note), audio
recordings are associated with the entry and not its senses.

To record audio, there is a red circle button. For each recorded audio, there is a green triangle button.

**With a mouse:** Click-and-hold the red circle to record. Click a green triangle to play its audio, or shift-click to
delete its recording.

**On a touch screen:** Press-and-hold the red circle to record. Tap a green triangle to play its audio, or
press-and-hold to bring up a menu (with options to play or delete).
