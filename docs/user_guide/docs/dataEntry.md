# Data Entry

## Semantic Domain Tree

Browse or search for the domain of interest.

!!! tip

    The Combine will automatically insert `.` between consectutive digits to make entering a domain quicker. For example,
    typing `1234` will automatically insert `1.2.3.4`. This behavior does not happen if there are any non-digit characters
    entered.

## New Entry

### Vernacular

A word as found in the vernacular language, usually spelled either phonetically or with the local orthography.

### Gloss

An entry can have multiple senses/glosses, though only one can be added when the entry is first created.

### Note

There is only one note per entry, even if the entry has multiple senses, glosses, or semantic domains.

### Recording

You can add multiple recordings to an entry (e.g., a male voice and a female voice), but as with the [Note](#note), they
are associated with the entry and not its senses.
