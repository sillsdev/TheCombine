# Projects

A project is for a single vernacular language.

### Vernacular and Analysis Languages

The _vernacular language_ is the language for which words are being collected. This is usually a local, indigenous,
minority, autochthonous, heritage, or endangered langauge or dialect.

The _analysis language_ is the language into which the vernacular language is being translated. This is usually a
regional, national, official, or majority language of the location where the vernacular is used.

### Import Existing Data

If you have linguistics data in a [LIFT](https://software.sil.org/lifttools) file (likely exported from The Combine,
[WeSay](https://software.sil.org/wesay), [FLEx](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks), or
[Lexique Pro](software.sil.org/lexiquepro)), you can hit the BROWSE button next to "Upload .zip project file?" to import
the data into your project.

## Manage a Project

When a project has been created or selected, it becomes the active projectâ€”you should see a gear icon and/or the project
name in the middle of the App Bar at the top of The Combine. Clicking on the gear icon or project name brings up Project
Settings for managing the project. The following settings are available for project users with sufficient permissions.

### Project Name

A distinguishing and descriptive name is recommended. The project name is part of the filename when you
[export](#import-and-export) your project.

### Vernacular and Analysis Languages

The vernacular language specified at project creation is fixed.

There may be multiple analysis languages associated with the project, but only the top one on the list here is
associated with new data entries.

!!! note

    If the project has glosses in multiple languages, those languages must be added here for all the glosses to show up in [data cleanup](goals.md). Click the magnifying glass icon to see all language codes present in the project.

### Import and Export

!!! note

    Currently, the maximum size of Lift files supported for import is 250MB.

!!! note

    Currently, only one LIFT file can be imported per project.

After clicking the Export button, you can navigate to other parts of the website. A download icon will appear in the App
Bar when the export is ready for download. The default filename is the [project name](#project-name) with a timestamp
affixed.

!!! important

    A project that has reached hundreds of MB in size may take multiple minutes to export.

### Autocomplete

The default setting is On: When a user is entering the [vernacular](dataEntry.md#vernacular) of a new entry in Data
Entry, this setting gives suggestions of similar existing entries, allowing the user to select an existing entry and add
a new sense to that entry, rather than creating a (mostly) duplicate to something previously entered.

(This does not effect the [gloss](dataEntry.md#gloss) spelling suggestions, which are based on a dictionary independent
of existing project data.)
