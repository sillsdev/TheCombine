# Adding Components to The Combine

Let's say you want to add a Login component to the app.

First, create the React component that handles login.

The component will need methods to register a user account, as well as to login.
This will require a database call or two. To make the component as reusable as
possible, we will pass in these methods through the component's props.

The component will also need access to the Redux store. The data you need from
the store should be passed in through props as well. To pass in the data, you
want to create a
[connected component](https://redux.js.org/basics/usage-with-react).

Adding a login component will require adding new state types to the store. You
want to add login state to the store. This should be defined in your reducers
file. The state should be added to the store state in src/types/index.tsx.

You will also need to create action creators and reducers, since you want to
be able to dispatch login actions to the store, and respond to the actions. The
reducer should be added to the root reducer, located in src/rootReducer.src.

Don't forget to write unit tests.
