# aws_profiles.yaml defines the structure used by set-aws/create_aws_config.py to change the environment variables
# that define the access rights for commands run with the aws v2 cli.  It also adds the AWS account number to the
# structure so that set-aws can define the AWS_ACCOUNT environment variable that is used by multiple convenience
# scripts and command aliases.

# This file shows a single profile to demonstrate the required structure.  Any number of profiles can be added.
# The access keys ids and secrets are defined in the IAM service in the AWS Console.
