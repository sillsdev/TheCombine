## Step-by-step Instructions
This section gives you step-by-step instructions for installing *The Combine* on a new NUC/PC with links to more detailed information.

### Prepare your host system
#### Linux Host

Install the following components:
 * Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop, 64-bit
 * Git
 * [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-apt-ubuntu)
 * [Nodejs](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#debinstall), install the LTS version, 10.x.
 * [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/linux-package-manager/ubuntu18-04/sdk-2.1.801) Be sure to select *Ubuntu 18.04 - x64* from the dropdown menu on the page.
 * clone the project [repo](https://github.com/sillsdev/TheCombine) to the working folder of your choice, e.g. <tt>$HOME/src</tt>

#### Windows host
The scripts for installing TheCombine use *Ansible* to manage an installation of *TheCombine*.  *Ansible* is not available for Windows.  There is a *Vagrant* vm that is available to provide an Ubuntu environment to build and install the application on an *Intel NUC* that can be deployed in the field.  If you only have access to a Windows PC, follow these instructions to build and deploy *TheCombine*.

  * Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
  * Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).  Note that if you are installing Vagrant on an Ubuntu host, you should select the Debian package rather than the generic Linux package.
  * Clone the project repo:
    ```
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sillsdev/TheCombine
    ```
  * open a command prompt and change directory to deploy/vagrant-installer sub-folder of the cloned project directory:
    ```
      cd ${COMBINE}/deploy/vagrant-installer
    ```
  * create and provision the VM:
    ```
      vagrant up
    ```
  * Once the vm is created, the Ubuntu login screen will be displayed.  Log in with the following credentials:
    ```
       Username: vagrant
       Password: vagrant
    ```
  * Open a terminal window (*Ctrl-Alt-T*).  This terminal window may be used to run the commands in the [Installing *TheCombine*](#installing-thecombine) section.

  Note that *TheCombine* project is only cloned the first time the vm is created and provisioned.  If you have created a vagrant-installer vm in the past, use <tt>git pull</tt> to update your repo and install the updated software on a target.

#### Create SSH config

In order to run the playbook that registers the NUC on the certificate server (or "demo server") you need to be able to <tt>ssh</tt> to the certificate server from your host machine (or from the VM if you are running Windows on your host machine).

Create an SSH config file (<tt>~/.ssh/config</tt>) to enable an <tt>ssh</tt> connection to the demo server.  The SSH config file shall contain the following configuration:
```
    Host thecombine
    HostName <ip_address_for_thecombine.languagetechnology.org>
    User <demo_server_login>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

```
Notes
  - the IP address for thecombine.languagetechnology.org is the actual IP address, not the one published by CloudFlare.
  - the demo_server_login account must have <tt>sudo</tt> priveleges on thecombine.languagetechnology.org.


### Installing *TheCombine*
These instructions are for installing *TheCombine* on a blank device. See [Updating *TheCombine*](#updating-thecombine) for instructions on updating the application on an existing installation.

### Running *TheCombine*

To run *TheCombine* on the NUC, connect to the WiFi access point created by the server; the access point SSID is *nuc_hostname*<tt>_ap</tt>.

Once you have connected to the WiFi Access Point, connect to the local instance of *TheCombine* by navigating to https://thecombine.languagetechnology.org with your web browser.

### Updating *TheCombine*

Once *TheCombine* has been installed on the NUC, you can update the application by running steps 5 - 8 in the section [Installing *TheCombine*](#installing-thecombine).

# Additional Details

## Install Ubuntu Bionic Server

  1. Download the ISO image for Ubuntu Server from Ubuntu (currently at http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/18.04.3/release/ubuntu-18.04.3-server-amd64.iso)

  1. copy the .iso file to a bootable USB stick:
     1. Ubuntu host: Use the *Startup Disk Creator*, or
     2. Windows host: follow the [tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview) on ubuntu.com.

  1. Boot the PC from the bootable media and follow the installation instructions.  In particular,
     1. You will want the installer to format the entire \[virtual\] disk. Using LVM is not recommended.

     1. *Make sure that you select the OpenSSH server when prompted to select the software for your server:*
  ![alt text](images/ubuntu-software-selection.png "Ubuntu Server Software Selection")

## Vault Password
The Ansible playbooks require that some of the variable files are encrypted.  When running one of the playbooks, you will need to provide the password for the encrypted files.  The password can be provided by:
  1. entering the password when prompted.  Add the <tt>--ask-vault-pass</tt> option for <tt>ansible-playbook</tt> to be prompted for the password when it is required.  This is the default for <tt>./setup-nuc.sh</tt>
  2. specify a file that has the password.  Add the <tt>--vault-password-file</tt> option for <tt>ansible-playbook</tt> followed by the path of a file that holds the vault password.
  3. set the environment variable <tt>ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE</tt> to the path of a file that holds the vault password.  This prevents you from needing to provide the vault password whenever you run an ansible playbook, either directly or from within a script such as <tt>setup-nuc.sh</tt>.  *Make sure that you are the only one with read permission for the password file!*

If you use a file to hold the vault password, then:
  * *Make sure that you are the only one with read permission for the password file!*
  * *Make sure that the password file is not tracked in the git repository!*  <p>For example, use hidden file in your home directory, such as <tt>$HOME/.ansible-vault</tt>, with mode of <tt>0600</tt>.</p>

## Setup NUC Options

There are some additional options for using the <tt>setup-nuc.sh</tt> script
and the <tt>playbook_publish.yml</tt> playbook.

1. <tt>setup-nuc.sh</tt> recognizes the following options:
   - <tt>--copyid</tt> copies your ssh public key to the NUC
   - <tt>--vault</tt> or <tt>--vault-password-file</tt> allows you to specify the name of a file that holds the Ansible vault password as the next argumnt.
   - <tt>-h</tt> or <tt>--help</tt> prints the usage text and exits
1. Any options that are not recognized by <tt>setup-nuc.sh</tt> are passed to the ansible playbooks that are called by <tt>setup-nuc.sh</tt>.  This is especially useful for specifying an alternate inventory file for development or testing purposes.  Note that files whose names end in <tt>".hosts"</tt> are ignored by git.

## Demo Server

The Demo Server has two purposes:
  1. it makes *TheCombine* available on the internet for demonstrations; and
  2. it creates and renews the SSL certificate for the demo server and all NUCs.

In order to setup the Demo Server,
  * create an SSH config file - see [Create SSH Config](#create-ssh-config)
  * run the following commands from the directory for *TheCombine* repo:
    ```
    cd deploy
    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -p roles_galaxy
    ansible-playbook playbook-server.yml -K
    certbot certonly --webroot --force-renewal
    ansible-playbook playbook-publish.yml -K --limit thecombine --ask-vault-pass
    ```
    Notes:
    - <tt>playbook_server.yml</tt> only needs to be run once.  In order to update to a newer version of *TheCombine*, only the <tt>playbook-publish.yml</tt> needs to be run.
    - <tt>playbook_server.yml</tt> currently uses the geerlingguy.certbot role to create the letsencrypt SSL certificate.  This role only supports the <tt>standalone</tt> challenge method.  Run the specified <tt>certbot</tt> command to convert the renewal to use webroot.  The <tt>standalone</tt> certificate requires shutting down the Apache web server to renew the certificate and then restarting it.
