  cat <<USAGE
  Usage: $0 [options]
     Removes old Combine backups from the AWS S3 bucket
  Options:
    -h, --help:
          print this message
    -d, --dry-run:
          print the commands to remove old backups instead of executing them
    -v, --verbose:
          print extra internal variable values to help with debugging

  Environment Variables:
    The script uses the following environment variables to determine how to cleanup
    the AWS S3 bucket:
     aws_bucket (required):
           URI of the AWS Bucket where the backups are stored

     combine_host (required):
           Name of the host for the combine with '.' characters replaced with '-'
           characters.  This is used to select the backups that shall be considered
           for pruning.

     max_backups:
           number of backups to keep for the host being cleaned up.  Default = 3
  Caveats:
    This script assumes that the backups have been created by the combine-backup
    script; specifically, that:
      1. The name of the backup is of the form:
          hostname-date.tar.gz
      2. Periods in the hostname are converted to dashes
      3. When the backups are sorted by name, they are in chronological order
         with the oldest backup first.
