# create_ap

`create_ap` is a bash shell script that creates a WiFi access point using `hostapd` and `dnsmasq`.

The `create_ap` file is downloaded from
https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot/blob/v4.7.2/src/scripts/create_ap. (`linux-wifi-hotspot` is a
[maintained fork](https://github.com/oblique/create_ap?tab=readme-ov-file#forks-and-continuation-of-this-project) of the
archived `create_ap` project, which worked for Ubuntu 22.04 but not for Ubuntu 24.04.) The customizations necessary for
_TheCombine_ are found in the `templates` directory for this role.
