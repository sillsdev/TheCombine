# To enable automatic backups of TheCombine, define the hour and minute for the
# backup in one of the variable files/sections for your playbook. For example,
#    backup_hour:  10
#    backup_minute: 15
# configures the backup to run every day at 10:15am (Combine Servers system time
# is set to UTC).
# The hour/minute values are in the format for cron tables.  See the man page
# for 'crontab(5)' for details.
#
# Currently the combine_backup role only supports daily backups.

# Define the number of backups to store in the AWS S3 bucket.  The default is
# to keep the last 3 backups for each server.
