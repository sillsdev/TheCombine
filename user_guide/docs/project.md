### Import existing Data

## Manage a Project

When a project has been created or selected, it becomes the active project, and the project name appears in the middle of the App Bar at the top of The Combine. Clicking on the project name brings up Project Settings for managing the project. The following project settings are available for project users with sufficient permissions.

### Project Name

### Vernacular and Analysis Languages

### Import and Export

Currently, only one LIFT file can be imported per project.

After clicking the Export button, you can navigate to other parts of the website. A notification with appear in the App Bar when the export is ready for download. A project that has reached hundreds of MB is size may take tens of minutes to export.

### Autocomplete

The default setting is On: When a user is entering the [vernacular](dataEntry.md#vernacular) of a new entry in Data Entry, this setting gives suggestions of similar existing entries, allowing the user to select an existing entry and add a new sense to that entry, rather than creating a (mostly) duplicate to something previously entered.

(This does not effect the [gloss](dataEntry.md#gloss) spelling suggestions, which are based on a dictionary independent of existing project data.)
